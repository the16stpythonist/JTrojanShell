###
The module to contain basic functionality for using gpsd compatible antennas
with the Raspberry Pi.
Before using this module make sure you have installed the necessary packages
on the raspberry pi, which would be automaticly installed issueing the command:
"sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps" and
"sudo gpsd /dev/ttyAMA0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock"
Module is designed to interact with the "GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Receiver"

    A class, which is basically wrapping the data output offered by any compatible USB Gps receiver, that is connected
    to the raspberry pi, making the data easily accessible by steadily updating the object properties according to the
    standard protocol output stream of the gps receiver. Because this is a very basic implementation of such
    functionality, the Thread is not only consuming quit a bit of processing capacity, but is also a whole lot slower
    than the origninal reciever, as the class is utilizing a slow serial uart connection to completely read the stream
    of the gps output to fetch the full protocol, which wouldnt be possible, when using the default python io streams.
    To function properly the object needs the string path of the stream location passed as an argument, which will most
    likely be a tty*** type of file in the /var folder
